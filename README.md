# Mobile Robotics - Lab4

## Objectives
- To create a transform that relates the camera frame to the robot's torso frame
- To calibrate and validate coordinates of blokcs with respect to the torso frame, as seen by camera

## Command sets:

1. **To play jsp files with Baxter in Gazebo**

[Learning ROS ws] `roslaunch baxter_gazeo baxter_world.launch`

[Learning ROS ws] `roslaunch baxter_launch_files baxter_playfile_nodes.launch`

- Suppose we use `arm1.jsp`, Redirect to the directory contain the file.

[This Repo ws] `rosrun baxter_playfile_nodes baxter_playback arm1.jsp`

2. **To show pcd files and demo block recognition in RViZ**

[Learning ROS ws] `roslaunch baxter_gazebo baxter_world.launch`

[Learning ROS ws] `roslaunch baxter_launch_files baxter_playfile_nodes.launch`

[Don't use this] `rosrun table_transform find_table_frame`

[This Repo ws] `roslaunch table_transform table_frame_wrt_cam.launch`

[This Repo ws] `roslaunch table_transform camera_frame_wrt_head.launch`

[This Repo ws] `rosrun table_transform find_block`
